                <h1>About me</h1>
                <p>
                    I am a first year student at the Pennsylvania State University majoring in Computer Science.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I am a member of Blockchain@PSU, a student run organization that fills the twofold purpose of  real time work and education on pertinent blockchain topics. I code in Python and have worked on multiple projects and also developed a course teaching python basics. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I have research experience in Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence. Since the spring of 2023, I've been a Research Assistant here at Penn State working for Professor Daniel Kifer. Differential privacy is the core of my research. Additionally, I carried out my own independent study in the field of Backdoor Detection in Deep Neural Networks, for which I was also awarded the Erickson Discovery Grant.

                    <br>
                    A facet where I could propagate my skills is leadership. As the Head of Design and Core Team Member at an international student run organization - Optiverse, I created presentations, designed social media posts, resolved queries and interacted with students - and my knowledge of superintendency and behavioral economics burgeoned.  
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    While money, time and measurements are the more salient aspects of math in real life, its underlying regard is what intrigues me immensely. To further my love for this unassailable subject, I co-founded a math club, Shunya. We tutored students in calculus and algebra, conducted study sessions on weekdays and had intellectual discussions on weekends. We also conducted a symposium of lectures and workshops promoting interdisciplinary knowledge of math.
