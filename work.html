                        <p>While money, time and measurements are the more salient aspects of math in real life, its underlying regard is what intrigues me immensely. To further my love for this unassailable subject, I co-founded a math club, Shunya. We tutored students in calculus and algebra, conducted study sessions on weekdays and had intellectual discussions on weekends. We also conducted a symposium of lectures and workshops promoting interdisciplinary knowledge of math.</p>
